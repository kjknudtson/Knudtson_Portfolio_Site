# Portfolio Site

## Description

This is a web site that I created so that I may showcase all current and future projects that I am working on, either for my Coding Bootcamp or extracurricular projects.  I am also hoping to have potentially employers be able to comtact me through my contact form (once it becomes operational).  I used html, CSS, and bootstrap in order to create this.  The pages included are a home page, an "About Me" page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page.

All four pages are responsive and have a navigation bar at the top of each of them, courtesy of bootstrap.  I included the JS scripts on each page so that the navigation bar will also work on smaller devices, when it swaps to a dropdown bar.  I did not use media queries in this project and used a combination of bootstrap's own responsive friendly nature, and adding separate CSS to allow the images to be able to respond to varying screen sizes.

I am hoping in the future to be able to add more projects in the future to the actual Portfolio page, and so I will be continuing to update this over the course of the next few months.  One of the hardest challenges was trying to restrain from using media queries and trying to find a way around them in order to make my images responsive, but I was able to find a way to do so, after a few Google searches.

Another future implementation that I will be working on is making the contact form operational.  At the moment it does not work, but I am confident in being able to do so in the immediate future.
